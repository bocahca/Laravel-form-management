```

## Usage
- Admin logs in, creates forms, views all submissions, and approves/rejects them.
- User logs in, fills out available forms, and views their submission history.
- On every new user submission, the system sends a Telegram notification.

## Telegram Integration
Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for BotFather.

2. Send /start and then /newbot.

3. Follow the prompts to set a name and username for your bot.

4. BotFather will provide a Bot Token ‚Äî copy it to .env as TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN.

Step 2: Get Your Chat ID
1. Start a conversation with your bot and send any message.

2. Open this URL in your browser:
```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
```
3. Find "chat":{"id":123456789,...} in the JSON response ‚Äî copy that number into .env as TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.

## Troubleshooting
- Telegram messages not sent?

    - Make sure you have started a chat with the bot manually.

    - Double-check TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in .env.

- Database connection failed?

    - Verify PostgreSQL is running and .env credentials match your database setup.

- Livewire components not updating?

    - Run npm run dev and ensure no caching issues in the browser.
